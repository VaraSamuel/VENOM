                                                                VENOM : YOUR PERSONAL SYMBIOTE
                                                              
  Venom is an AI voice desktop assidtant whose inspiration was taken from the the movie VENOM, and its main motive was to provide the teachers and the students with access to the data required using voice commands. Venom uses speech recognition API's. The code which is submitted abvove is the basic bare bones code, and it will be further developed with an application interface. Venom has been tested by the faculty of SRM UNIVERSITY and has proven to be quite useful and it was asked to be implemented throughout the whole university to all of the faculty. So venom would be avilable to all the people in a few days to everyone and everyone can have their own personal symbiote.
  
  
                      THE IDEA
➢ A PERSONAL VOICE ASSISTANT FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS
➢ AN INTERFACE BETWEEN YOUR VOICE AND THE RESOURCEES
REQUIRED.
➢ FAST AND HASSEL FREE ACCESS TO DATA FOR BETTER UTILIZATION
OF TIME AND ENERGY.
➢ INSPIRATION FROM VENOM THE SYMBIOTE

                THE BACKSTORY OF VENOM
                
➢ Every child's dream is to have a personal friend who does what he is
asked to do, Advices and helps in times of need, therefore it can
be put as a friend in need, especially one who helps you with your
education.
➢ It was the year 2018, where AI voice recognition wasn’t at its full
bloom and a task was given by the teacher and both the teacher
and the student were tired after an event which took place earlier
and no one wanted to do the task of manually performing typing
and searching the web for resources, which caused the work to be
procrastinated therefore leading to the wastage of valuable time of
the students and the teachers, that’s when the thought about
VENOM was born a fully voice-automated Software which could do
anything we ask for using voice commands.

                      TECH STACK
                      
The tech stack which is required for the working of Venom are:
➢ Basic knowledge of Python Language
➢ Knowledge on NLP
➢ A basic idea about the API'S needed
➢ Access to an unrestricted Network Service.
➢ Google open source permission to access web-services which are in 
association with google.

                  SIMILAR PROJECTS
                  
➢ Google has created its own voice assistant
➢ Cortana by Microsoft
➢ Siri by Apple
     
            HOW VENOM IS BETTER THAN THE OTHERS?
            
➢ Venom has the ability to adapt to whatever you require without any
restrictionsfrom any third party apps.
➢ It is more reliable and much faster
➢ It is open for integration with the third party apps via Voice Actions
API.
➢ Venom gives the student to access to alter Venoms code so
that he/she can use it for several purposes rather than the restricted
ones.
➢ Thus making Venom more personal than any other voice assistants,
which run a restricted resource space like Google's voice Assistant
or Apples's Siri.

              SOCIAL IMPACT AND SCALABILITY
              
➢ If VENOM can be implemented in all the educational institutions 
and is available to every student, they will have an unbound access 
to resource right at their fingertips.
➢ It would reduce the exertion of teachers which are already 
burdened by a lot of subjective work, On using Venom they can 
now concentrate and spend more time on studentstherefore 
enabling them to understand their concepts in a much better way.
➢ This would completely change how students perceive their subjects, 
cause now they would be able to interact with their friend Venom 
and learn from him, as people tend to listen to their friends rather 
than strangers.
            
            ROAD-BLOCKS AND HOW THEY ARE SOLVED
            
➢ Language always proves to be the major road block.
• But it is being rectified by creating various language interfaces for various 
diversities.
➢ Background Noise causes the software to take more time to recognize the 
commands.
• This has been eradicated by altering a few bits of code therefore making it more 
fast and therefore this problem has been eradicated.
➢ Security might be an issue, cause nothing can be totally safe
